1️⃣ Think of a VPC as a “big box of IPs”

Example: 10.0.0.0/16

This is your VPC.

/16 means you have 65,536 IP addresses to use.

2️⃣ Subnets are smaller boxes inside the VPC

You don’t want all IPs in one big pool.

You divide the VPC into subnets (smaller boxes) for different purposes: public, private, database, etc.

Example:

Subnet Type	Size	CIDR (example)
public	/24	10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255
private	/24	10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255
database	/24	10.0.2.0 - 10.0.2.255

/24 → each subnet has 256 IP addresses.

3️⃣ Availability Zones (AZs) = “different city districts”

AWS AZs are separate locations inside a region.

To be fault-tolerant, you create the same subnets in multiple AZs.

Example:

AZ1: public-a, private-a, database-a

AZ2: public-b, private-b, database-b

AZ3: public-c, private-c, database-c

4️⃣ How Terraform handles it

locals.subnets → tells how big each subnet should be.

module "subnets" → calculates all the IP ranges for every subnet × AZ.

module "vpc" → actually creates the VPC and the subnets in AWS using those IP ranges.

🔑 TL;DR

VPC → the whole network.

Subnet → a smaller network inside VPC, e.g., public/private/database.

AZs → copy subnets into multiple zones for reliability.

Terraform modules → just calculate IP ranges and create the VPC/subnets automatically.

If you want, I can draw a simple visual diagram showing VPC → AZs → subnets with real CIDR ranges. That usually makes it click instantly.

Do you want me to do that?

Good question 👌
Let’s focus just on Availability Zones (AZs) to make that part clear.

🌍 Step 1: AWS Region

An AWS Region is a geographical area.
👉 Example: eu-west-3 (Paris)

This region is like a country.

🏙️ Step 2: Availability Zones = “separate data centers” in that region

Inside each region, AWS has multiple physical data centers.
These are called Availability Zones (AZs).
👉 Example in eu-west-3:

eu-west-3a

eu-west-3b

eu-west-3c

They are physically separated buildings (maybe even kilometers apart), each with its own power, cooling, network, etc.

📌 This means if one AZ goes down (power cut, fire, etc.), the others keep running.

🧠 Step 3: Why create the same subnet in multiple AZs?

Let’s say you have a public subnet for web servers.

If you only put it in eu-west-3a, and that AZ goes down → ❌ all your servers go offline.

But if you create:

public-eu-west-3a

public-eu-west-3b

public-eu-west-3c

Then your application can run in 3 different data centers.
If one fails → the others still work ✅

👉 This is called fault tolerance (survive failures).

🧱 Visual Analogy

Region = a city (e.g., Paris).

AZs = different neighborhoods (e.g., District A, District B, District C), each with its own power grid.

You build identical buildings (subnets) in each neighborhood.

If District A has a blackout, your buildings in District B and C still have lights on.

🌐 In Terraform

When you write:

variable "availability_zones" {
  type = list(string)
}

# Example value
availability_zones = ["eu-west-3a", "eu-west-3b", "eu-west-3c"]


Terraform will create:

A public subnet in each AZ

A private subnet in each AZ

A database subnet in each AZ
etc.

So you end up with multiple subnets with different CIDR blocks, but all part of one VPC.

✅ Summary:

AZ = physical data center in the region

Same subnets in multiple AZs → high availability, fault tolerance

Terraform automates subnet creation for each AZ to give you redundancy.

1. Resource = A Single Piece of Infrastructure

A resource in Terraform represents one specific infrastructure component (e.g., EC2 instance, S3 bucket, VPC, etc.).
It is the lowest-level building block.

📌 Example: AWS EC2 instance resource
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}


✅ This creates one EC2 instance.
Terraform will manage its lifecycle (create, update, delete) directly.

📦 2. Module = A Container / Group of Resources

A module is a collection of resources that are grouped together to achieve a higher-level functionality.
Think of it like a function in programming — you can reuse it multiple times instead of writing the same resources over and over.

Modules can contain:

Multiple resource blocks

variables, outputs, locals

Even other modules (nested)

📌 Example: Using a VPC module
module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "5.0.0"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["eu-west-3a", "eu-west-3b"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24"]
}


✅ Here:

The module creates multiple underlying resources: VPC, subnets, route tables, gateways, etc.

You don’t need to define each resource manually — the module handles it for you.

The module acts like a reusable “package”.

🧠 Key Differences Table
Feature	Resource 🧱	Module 📦
Definition	A single piece of infrastructure	A container that groups multiple resources
Purpose	To manage a specific component	To reuse, organize, and group related resources
Example	aws_instance, aws_s3_bucket	terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws
Reusability	Usually defined once	Can be reused across projects or multiple times in one file
Complexity	Simple	Can be simple or complex
Who writes it	Usually you	Can be you or the community (Terraform Registry modules)
🧠 Analogy

Think of Terraform code like building a house:

🧱 Resources = the individual bricks, windows, doors, or wires.

📦 Modules = the pre-designed rooms (e.g., kitchen module, bathroom module) built from those bricks.

You can build the house by placing each brick manually (resources), or by using prebuilt rooms (modules) to speed up the process and stay organized.

📝 Bonus: You Can Create Your Own Modules

For example, you could put your own reusable configuration in a folder:

modules/
  ec2-instance/
    main.tf
    variables.tf
    outputs.tf


Then use it like:

module "app_server" {
  source = "./modules/ec2-instance"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
}

✅ Summary:

Resource = single infrastructure item (atomic unit).

Module = reusable collection of resources, like a function or package.

Modules help you organize, reuse, and standardize Terraform code.







!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🔹 First, what is “resource creation sequencing”?

When Terraform creates resources (like servers, databases, networks, etc.),
some of them depend on others.

Example:

You must create a VPC (network) before creating an EC2 instance inside it.

You must create an S3 bucket before uploading files to it.

So Terraform must know in what order to create things.

🔹 Terraform’s solution: the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Terraform automatically builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of your resources.

Let’s break this term:

Directed → the arrows show which resources depend on which.
Example: VPC → Subnet → EC2 Instance
(meaning: the subnet depends on the VPC, and the EC2 depends on the subnet)

Acyclic → there are no loops.
You can’t have a circular dependency like A depends on B and B depends on A.

So Terraform draws a map of all resources and their dependencies.

🔹 Then it uses a topological sort algorithm

This is a fancy way to say:

Terraform looks at the graph and automatically figures out which resources can be created first, and which must wait for others.

Example:

resource "aws_vpc" "main" { ... }
resource "aws_subnet" "subnet1" { vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id }
resource "aws_instance" "web" { subnet_id = aws_subnet.subnet1.id }


Terraform will:

Create the VPC first (no dependencies)

Then the Subnet (depends on the VPC)

Then the Instance (depends on the Subnet)

You don’t need to tell Terraform this — it understands automatically from the references.

🔹 If automatic sequencing fails → use depends_on

Sometimes Terraform can’t detect a dependency automatically (for example, with indirect dependencies).

In that case, you can manually tell Terraform the order using depends_on.

Example:

resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami           = "ami-123"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  depends_on    = [aws_s3_bucket.bucket]
}


This tells Terraform:

“Do not create the EC2 instance until the S3 bucket is ready.”

💡 Summary
Concept	Explanation
DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)	A map of all resources and their dependencies
Topological Sort	Algorithm that finds the correct order to create resources
Automatic Sequencing	Terraform figures out dependencies from your code
depends_on	Manual way to tell Terraform which resource must come first
✅ In short:

Terraform builds a dependency graph (DAG), sorts it to know what to create first, and automatically handles the order.
If Terraform can’t figure it out, you can help it by adding depends_on.






---------------------------------------------------------------------------

bastion_ingress
variable "bastion_ingress" {
  default     = []
  description = "List of CIDR blocks to whitelist for bastion host"
  type        = list(string)
}

🧠 Explanation

This variable is a list of CIDR blocks (IP ranges) that are allowed to access your Bastion host (via SSH typically).

“Whitelisting” means only IPs in these CIDR blocks are allowed to connect.

If not provided, it defaults to an empty list [], meaning no external access unless specified.

📝 Example usage

In terraform.tfvars:

bastion_ingress = ["192.168.1.0/24", "203.0.113.45/32"]


In a security group rule:

module "security_group_bastion" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/security-group/aws"
  version = "5.3.0"

  name        = "${var.name}-bastion"
  description = "Security group for bastion host"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.main.id

  ingress_with_cidr_blocks = [
    for cidr in var.bastion_ingress : {
      rule        = "ssh-tcp"
      cidr_blocks = cidr
    }
  ]
}


👉 This allows SSH access only from the specified IPs (e.g., your office or home network).
