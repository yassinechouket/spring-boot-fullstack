1️⃣ Think of a VPC as a “big box of IPs”

Example: 10.0.0.0/16

This is your VPC.

/16 means you have 65,536 IP addresses to use.

2️⃣ Subnets are smaller boxes inside the VPC

You don’t want all IPs in one big pool.

You divide the VPC into subnets (smaller boxes) for different purposes: public, private, database, etc.

Example:

Subnet Type	Size	CIDR (example)
public	/24	10.0.0.0 - 10.0.0.255
private	/24	10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.255
database	/24	10.0.2.0 - 10.0.2.255

/24 → each subnet has 256 IP addresses.

3️⃣ Availability Zones (AZs) = “different city districts”

AWS AZs are separate locations inside a region.

To be fault-tolerant, you create the same subnets in multiple AZs.

Example:

AZ1: public-a, private-a, database-a

AZ2: public-b, private-b, database-b

AZ3: public-c, private-c, database-c

4️⃣ How Terraform handles it

locals.subnets → tells how big each subnet should be.

module "subnets" → calculates all the IP ranges for every subnet × AZ.

module "vpc" → actually creates the VPC and the subnets in AWS using those IP ranges.

🔑 TL;DR

VPC → the whole network.

Subnet → a smaller network inside VPC, e.g., public/private/database.

AZs → copy subnets into multiple zones for reliability.

Terraform modules → just calculate IP ranges and create the VPC/subnets automatically.

If you want, I can draw a simple visual diagram showing VPC → AZs → subnets with real CIDR ranges. That usually makes it click instantly.

Do you want me to do that?

Good question 👌
Let’s focus just on Availability Zones (AZs) to make that part clear.

🌍 Step 1: AWS Region

An AWS Region is a geographical area.
👉 Example: eu-west-3 (Paris)

This region is like a country.

🏙️ Step 2: Availability Zones = “separate data centers” in that region

Inside each region, AWS has multiple physical data centers.
These are called Availability Zones (AZs).
👉 Example in eu-west-3:

eu-west-3a

eu-west-3b

eu-west-3c

They are physically separated buildings (maybe even kilometers apart), each with its own power, cooling, network, etc.

📌 This means if one AZ goes down (power cut, fire, etc.), the others keep running.

🧠 Step 3: Why create the same subnet in multiple AZs?

Let’s say you have a public subnet for web servers.

If you only put it in eu-west-3a, and that AZ goes down → ❌ all your servers go offline.

But if you create:

public-eu-west-3a

public-eu-west-3b

public-eu-west-3c

Then your application can run in 3 different data centers.
If one fails → the others still work ✅

👉 This is called fault tolerance (survive failures).

🧱 Visual Analogy

Region = a city (e.g., Paris).

AZs = different neighborhoods (e.g., District A, District B, District C), each with its own power grid.

You build identical buildings (subnets) in each neighborhood.

If District A has a blackout, your buildings in District B and C still have lights on.

🌐 In Terraform

When you write:

variable "availability_zones" {
  type = list(string)
}

# Example value
availability_zones = ["eu-west-3a", "eu-west-3b", "eu-west-3c"]


Terraform will create:

A public subnet in each AZ

A private subnet in each AZ

A database subnet in each AZ
etc.

So you end up with multiple subnets with different CIDR blocks, but all part of one VPC.

✅ Summary:

AZ = physical data center in the region

Same subnets in multiple AZs → high availability, fault tolerance

Terraform automates subnet creation for each AZ to give you redundancy.
