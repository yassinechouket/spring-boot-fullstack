1 -> Deployment Strategies for Any App
     From startup to scale, deploy containers to AWS using the infrastructure your team requires.
      Get your app line fast with AWS App Runner.
      Evolve your CI/CD pipeline to ECS with Terraform, and manage your infrastructure with code.

 2 -> Automation and Optimization
      A growing team and application need automation. Add database migrations and a makefile for improved developer ergonomics.
       Optimize the container with multi-stage Docker builds for faster deployments.


3 -> Build a Deployment Pipeline
     Master GitHub Actions. Configure blue/green deployments for multiple environments.
      Use branches and tags to promote successful deployments to production and ship confidently with a robust CI/CD pipeline.

4 -> Migrate your database to RDS. Scale your application with ECS clusters, load balancing, and a CloudFront CDN.
    Learn the infrastructure required to ship high-performance enterprise applications.
